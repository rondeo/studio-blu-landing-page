    <Header>Starting a creative project is exciting.</Header>
    <Paragraph>Yet, hiring a creative professional is often a complicated process. You collect recommendations from friends and family, browse online, and hope to find the right person that fits your budget.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>On the flip side, freelance creatives spend much of their time marketing their services and hustling to bid on contracts â€” instead of brainstorming, building, sketching, painting, exploring, and creating.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>So we started a company to simplify this process. Our goals are twofold: make it easier for clients to find the creative professional of their dreams, and empower creatives to get paid so they can get back to what they do best.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph><strong>Ultimately, we want to turn more creative dreams into reality.</strong></Paragraph>
