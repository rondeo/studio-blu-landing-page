      Does Studio Blu own any of the rights to the photos I post on the
      platform?
    </Header>
    <Paragraph>
      Studio Blu does not own any of the content you post on our platform. This
      means we will never use your images or words without permission. Feel free
      to watermark your images.

    <Header>Transparent pricing makes me a little uncomfortable.</Header>
    <Paragraph>
      We know pricing your services is difficult - especially when there are so
      many variables at play. We only ask that you make your estimated hourly
      rate transparent so that potential clients can search within their budget.

      Remember: Your skills as a creative are valuable! At Studio Blu, we want
      to empower you to charge fairly (read: more) for the value you provide.
